Homemade Matlab Audio Tools
=====
### What are these
MATLAB codes I made during my research. Mostly, frequency modulation (FM) and fast Fourier transformation (FFT) tools made without the use of MATLAB's Audio Toolbox.

FM modulation core based on MATLAB code by [Sarita Singh](https://github.com/sritasngh).
