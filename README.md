Misc MATLAB Audio Tools
=====
### What are these
MATLAB codes I made during my research. Mostly, frequency modulation (FM) and fast Fourier transformation (FFT) tools made to use without MATLAB's Audio Toolbox.

FM modulation core based on MATLAB code by [Sarita Singh](https://github.com/sritasngh).

### Features
-  Quick audio figure tool with waveform, spectrogram and FFT
-  Making sine-wave AM and FM audio clips
-  (For marmoset audio research) Getting a vocal call's F0, find polyfit function, and create call-like FM matrix based on the generated F0 polyfit function.
